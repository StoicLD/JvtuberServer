# VTuber_Unity
Use Unity 3D character and Python deep learning algorithms to stream as a VTuber!

I have borrowed code from this project [OpenVTuberProject](https://github.com/kwea123/OpenVTuberProject), which provides many toolkits for becoming a VTuber.
And I just use this code for learnning and practicing my skill, so I won't use it for any commercial goals. 
If you want to use it for any commercial goals, please connect with the origin writter first.
